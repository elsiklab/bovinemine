#contains only classes that come from more than one source
#for each class contained every source for that class must be listed

# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:
#
#ProteinDomain.shortName = bovine-interpro, bovine-uniprot, bovine-uniprot-sec,*, bovine-uniprot-fasta 
#Protein.primaryAccession =   bovine-uniprot, bovine-uniprot-sec,*, bovine-uniprot-fasta
# To give flybase priority over all other sources for Gene name:
#
# Gene.name = flybase, *
ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, *
Protein.organism = bovine-uniprot, bovine-go-annotation, *
